# Handwritten Digit Classification Android app

## Overview
This project comprises of my experiments in deploying trained deep learning models in Android framework. I trained two seperate models for the task of Handwritten Digit Classification using Keras and Tensorflow. In the app implementation, I have used the model trained using Keras, as it had a better performance, but the process is extremely similar for the tensorflow model as well. Read more about deploying tensorflow models on mobile [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/mobile/).

I used the popular MNIST dataset for this task. The significant focus is on deploying the trained model in Android framework, rather than training a classification model. If you need to understand the task of classifying handwritten digits, [this](https://github.com/darshanbagul/USPS_Digit_Classification) is a good starting point.

## Results

Here are a few output results, which depict the UI of the app along with the classification results.
